# Assessment-tasks
You are free to use any methods and frameworks. Don't hesitate to submit unfinished tasks. **You will be marked based on the portion you deliver and how readable your code is.**

## Task A: Data Analytics ✨
The Student Social Media & Relationships dataset contains anonymized records of students’ social‐media behaviors and related life outcomes. It spans multiple countries and academic levels, focusing on key dimensions such as usage intensity, platform preferences, and relationship dynamics. Each row represents one student’s survey response, offering a cross‐sectional snapshot.

What you will perform:
- **Correlation Studies**: Examine associations between daily usage hours and mental‐health score or sleep hours. (also calculate P-value)
- **Predictive Modeling**: Predict relationship conflicts based on usage patterns and platform type.
- **Clustering**: Identify user segments (e.g., “high‐usage high‐stress” vs. “moderate‐usage balanced”) across *countries*.
- **Data Visualization**: Create beautiful graphs and plots for bonus points ⚡


## Task B: Agent Building 🤖
Let's go ahead and test your AI agent-building capabilities. Design and implement a multi-agent system that:
- Accepts user queries related to a document or set of documents.
- Summarizes relevant parts of the documents.
- Answers user queries based on the summarized information.
- Provides citations (source references) for the answers.


## Task C (Optional 🤗)
- What do you know about MCP?
- How do you build an MCP server? Give Psudocode.
